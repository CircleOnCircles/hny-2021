## iMessage by @CircleOnCircles

### 1st tried, using `py-iMessage`

I tried `py-iMessage`. At first glare, it seems very promising, last update is 5 months, pypi got a 9k of downloads
and the number of issue seems small. I went thru all the risky work of disabling kernel protection.

To no anvil, tries after tries I cannot send any messages with `py-iMessage`.

### 2nd tried, Reverse Engineer `PorterHouse`
PorterHouse, itself is working if you happen to live in US. the app requires you to test send iMessage and SMS.
The SMS is using a US number which is impossible for me to send. Another problem is that Dec 2020, I cannot send any sms with my
iMessage on macOS.

I tweeted the electron code, so that I could change to Thai number and skip sms verification.
